/*
  This file is for app-specific global styles for 'apps/dashboard'.
  Base styles, Tailwind directives (@tailwind base, components, utilities),
  and CSS variable definitions are primarily handled by `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
  which should be pulled in via the ClientThemeProvider in `_app.tsx`.

  Add dashboard-app-specific global styles here only if absolutely necessary.
  Prefer Tailwind utility classes or component-scoped styles.
